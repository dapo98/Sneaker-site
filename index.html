      <p>
        Shoes being real authentic and not "knock-offs" being passed as the real shoe has been a way to scam people from getting what they truly paid for for years. Depending on the shoe, there may be unique features to determine whether your sneakers are true. For example one way to determine the iconic Jordan "Jumpman" will be the easiest way to tell if they are fakes. Checking for any out of proportion areas on the logo too. Also make sure the logo is in the right position, many times fakes will have the Jumpman's arms or legs slightly different. Additionally, check the logo by the tongue of the shoe. Be sure to take careful consideration of the construction of the shoes. Look at the detail by the laces. Are they all straight, and are the spaces in between them even?  Take note of the stitching quality. Pay close attention to the heel of the shoe. If the stitching is frayed, or uneven it’s a fake. Look for the midsole point as well. This is where the bottom of the shoe transitions to the front of the shoe. On real Jordans, the midsole point is below the last lace hole. A genuine Air Max will have the logo applied directly to the sneaker. Look to see if there is any loose stitching or glue. The genuine air max will usually be of one color and should not feel soft of rubbery. Fake sneakers often use cheap material so this logo can often feel cheap and soft. As for Yeezy's If you can, go to a store that has a good reputation and try something on in store and get an idea of what you’re shopping for. If online, look for red flags, like, is the price too low? What’s missing? If they’re selling box-less, don’t trust those if not fimiliar with the site. Only go on a site where you can get your refund back. Really, for any shoe the best way to determine aunthenicity is to buy from a seller you know to be relaible whether online or in store.
